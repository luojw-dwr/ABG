# ABG

Inspired by [Licheng-Guo/AutoBridge](https://github.com/Licheng-Guo/AutoBridge), added support for any pre-defined topology of the underlying FPGA through ILP.

(The repo is still under heavy development. No documents will be provided until the basic tool flow has been finished and verified.)
